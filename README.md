# tea_explorer

In this project, we use Java in order to create a very simple "game." A user will tell the game how much money they have to spend, and then will attempt to buy as many "points"' worth of tea and tea accessories as they can with their chosen budget.

This project began on July 2, 2021, as inspired by members of the "Wholesome Tea Friends" server on Discord.
