In this project, we use Java in order to create a very simple "game." A user will tell the game how much money they have to spend, and then will attempt to buy as many "cha Qi" (points)' worth of tea and tea accessories as they can with their chosen budget.

Currently, the progress has arrived at asking the player how much they want to spend, then asking them which store they want to shop at.  Each time they "buy" an item, their funds go down by $10, until they run out of money.  The program then echoes back to the player how many items they bought.

This project began on July 2, 2021, as inspired by members of the "Wholesome Tea Friends" and "Liquid Proust" servers on Discord.
